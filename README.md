# Haskell Tutorials
Planning and Code for the Practical- and Theoretical- Approach to Haskell Tutorial Series.

The goal of these series are to offer
1) A relatively short, but comprehensive overview of the Haskell Language
  a) An introduction to Haskell's syntax and paradigm
  b) An approach to understanding and using monads which is woefully under-used in other monad tutorials
  c) Build something cool (likely a lambda calculus interpreter) in the early parts
  d) Introduce general Haskell idioms, including functor/applicative styles, ad-hoc overloading with typeclasses, and worker/wrapper functions
2) A more in-depth portion which dives deeper into useful aspects of the language
  a) Useful existing, but less important typeclasses like Semigroup, Monoid, Traversable, Foldable, etc.
  b) Language extensions: BangPatterns, OverloadedStrings, ExistentialQuantification, LambdaCase, GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving, etc.
  c) More discussion of monads

3) A theoretical, but hopefully simple and intuition-focused treatment of the math behind the language
  a) Built heavily off of Bartosz Milewski's [Category Theory for Progammers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)
  b) Types as a category (this is more involved than it may seem and will cover several videos)
  c) The universal construction
  d) (Endo)functors on the category of types, natural transformations, and the relation to Haskell Functors
  e) Categorical monads and Kleisli categories
  f) The Curry-Howard Correspondence
  
This repository contains (will contain) planning for the contents of videos, including possibly scripts and prepared code.
