Major goals: Introduce typeclasses, HOFs, list syntax
Minor goals:
1) Major existing typeclasses and what they do: Eq, Ord, Enum, Show, Read
2) Creating typeclasses
3) First class functions: Higher order functions, data which store functions, map/filter
3) A pretty-printer for our lambda interpreter, using custom typeclass to overload
